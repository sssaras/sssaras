# 💻 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi! I'm Sara, a Computer Science graduate from Università di Parma, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the same university. My journey started with curiosity and small projects — and now I'm looking foward to learn more about data analysis, NLP, and computational linguistics.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 BSc in Computer Science @ Università di Parma — graduated 2024/2025
- 📖 Currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science @ Università di Parma
- 🧠 My Bachelor's thesis explored **computational indices for linguistic coherence analysis**, applying NLP techniques to clinical interviews of people with and without schizophrenia spectrum disorder
- 💡 Passionate about data analysis, natural language processing, and finding meaning in messy, real-world data

## 🔬 Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — text preprocessing, semantic similarity, word embeddings
- **Computational Linguistics** — discourse coherence, lexical cohesion, connective analysis
- **Data Analysis & Statistics** — univariate analysis, hypothesis testing, working with clinical and linguistic datasets

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Languages:** Python, Java, HTML, CSS
- **NLP & ML:** spaCy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers, scikit-learn, Gensim
- **Data:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, SciPy
- **Dev tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

- Deepening my knowledge of machine learning and data science
- Exploring further applications of NLP in clinical and social contexts
- Building projects that bridge computer science and real-world impact

## 🎯 Goals

- Grow as a data scientist/NLP practitioner through research and hands-on projects
- Contribute to open-source projects in the NLP and data analysis space
- Keep learning — every day a little more than yesterday
